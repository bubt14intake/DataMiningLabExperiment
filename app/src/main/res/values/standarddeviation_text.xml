        The standard deviation is the square root of variance. Thus the way we calculate standard deviation is very similar to the way we calculate variance.
        In fact, to calculate standard deviation, we first need to calculate the variance, and then take its square root.\n\n

            σ = standard deviation\n\n

            xi = each value of dataset\n\n

            x (with a bar over it) = the arithmetic mean of the data (This symbol will be indicated as mean from now)\n\n

            N = the total number of data points\n\n

            ∑ (xi - mean)^2 = The sum of (xi - mean)^2 for all datapoints\n\n
